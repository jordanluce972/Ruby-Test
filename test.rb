Here's a quick task:
Create a ruby program that can be called from the command line as such: ./hiring_test 12 45 or ./hiring_test 42 19.

The program must print every number between ARGV[0] and ARGV[1], inclusive with the following condition:

If the number is divisible by 5, print Fire.
If the number is divisible by 7, print Water.
If the number is divisible by 35, print FireWater.
Otherwise print the number.

<Example>
$ ./interview_response.txt 0 40

Please send an email to si@globalwaterintel.com with a CC to tc@globalwaterintel.com having

subject: Solution to puzzle
body: #the source code to your solution#

Everything in the body of the email will be copypasted into a file called 'hiring_test'.

I will then run the command 'chmod +x hiring_test' and then expect commands such as './hiring_test 21 55' to behave according to spec.
